# Learning Log - Weekly Progress Tracking

This log captures weekly progress snapshots. Update each Sunday evening to keep the narrative consistent for portfolio use.

---

## Week 0: Setup

- ✅ GitHub repo created
- ✅ Python environment ready
- ✅ C++ compiler working
- ✅ README written

### Time Invested
- Total: ~1.7 hours
- Coding: ~0.4 hours (Python sanity scripts + C++ hello world)
- Setup: ~1.3 hours (env + documentation)

### Commits
1. `Add weekly planning docs and week 0 progress`
2. _(Reserved)_ Initial repo structure
3. _(Reserved)_ Python environment setup

### Lessons Learned
- Pinning packages for the target Python version avoids build-from-source headaches.
- Simple verification scripts (Python + C++) save time when re-running setup later.

### Next Week Focus
- Python: Build simple SMA backtest prototype.
- C++: Outline CSV ingestion and indicator scaffolding.
- Integration: Define the JSON/CSV bridge expectations early.

## 💡 Notes & Insights

**What went well:**  
- WSL toolchain already had g++, reducing friction.  
- AI-assisted template population kept documentation consistent.

**Challenges:**  
- 

**Next week preparation:**  
- Review pandas rolling-window docs.  
- Outline data download scripts (`yfinance`).  
- Decide on first strategy (likely SMA crossover).
