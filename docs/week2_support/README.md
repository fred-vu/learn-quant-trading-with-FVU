# Week 2 Support Docs

This folder collects the artifacts used to document Week 2 experiments.

- `blog-wema-rsi.md`: Deep dive covering WEMA crossovers paired with RSI neutral filters (SPY, QQQ, BTC) plus the latest BTC RSI-exit tests.
- `results/week2/`: Trade logs, CSVs, and equity curves referenced throughout the blog and learning log.

Use this directory for any additional writeups, prompts, or reference material created during Week 2.
